# Fitting models of population dynamics in discrete-time to explain common vole cycles

In this presentation, I will build on a published paper on common vole population dynamics [Barraquand, F., Pinot, A., Yoccoz, N. G., & Bretagnolle, V. (2014). Overcompensation and phase effects in a cyclic common vole population: between first and second‐order cycles. Journal of Animal Ecology, 83(6), 1367-1378.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12257). In this paper, we fit discrete-time population dynamics models to counts of vole populations in western France. I will use this work as a vehicle to introduce you to:
- how to switch from continuous to discrete-time and why discrete-time models can differ from continuous time ones
- the concept of overcompensation, and how it plays a role here in common vole cycles
- how to fit various such models in a simplified setup where we remove (i) spatial replication (ii) phase-dependence (iii) seasonality that are all complexifying feature of the common vole story but do not change the main cycle generation mechanism.
